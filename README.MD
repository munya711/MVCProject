Event Management System

This project provides a PHP-based solution for managing events. It allows users to create, view, and potentially manage (depending on your implementation) events through a web interface.

Installation

NB: instructions for database migration are in the database migration FILE

Prerequisites:
PHP: Ensure you have PHP installed on your system. XAMPP is a convenient option as it bundles PHP with an Apache web server and MySQL database server.
Database Setup:
Create a database named event_management_system. You can use a database management tool or your web hosting provider's control panel.
Edit the config.php file to configure database connection details such as host, username, password, and database name.
Table Creation:
Execute the necessary SQL statements to create the required tables in the database. These tables might include:
users (id, name, surname, email, password)
events (eventId, userId (foreign key referencing users.id), title, description, date_and_time, location, image_path (optional))
You can find or create these SQL statements based on your specific needs and data model.
Running the Project

Start XAMPP: Launch XAMPP and ensure both Apache and MySQL are running.
Project Location: Place the project files within XAMPP's web server document root directory (typically htdocs or public_html).
Access the Application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/your_project_directory/index.php (replace your_project_directory with the actual name of your project folder).
Usage (Expand based on your project's functionality)

Users can potentially create accounts, log in, view events, and potentially create or manage events (depending on your implementation).
The specific actions and permissions will depend on the features you've built into your system.

Additional Notes

Consider using a dependency management tool like Composer for managing PHP libraries and dependencies.
Implement security best practices, including input validation, secure password hashing, and user authentication mechanisms.
Unit testing your code would help ensure proper functionality and maintainability.
Remember to adapt this README.md with specific details of your project's functionality, database structure, and security measures. If you have documentation, provide a link or instructions on how to access it.
